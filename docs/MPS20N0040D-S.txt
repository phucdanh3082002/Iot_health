Circuit 
 

 

Difference Amplifier 

This amplifier uses both inverting and 
non-inverting inputs with a gain of one to 
produce an output equal to the difference 
between the inputs. It is a special case of 
the differential amplifier. You can also 
choose the resistances to amplify the 
difference.
